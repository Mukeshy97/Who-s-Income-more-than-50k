# Who's-Income-more-than-50k
Using Machine learning Performed a logistic regression model to see which features contribute more to the income over a sample size of 33,000, I do some data exploration,
visualisation and then model building using R Studio, with 82.40% accuracy. The conclusion drew various factors like Marital status, Working Hours and Gender really matters 
if you want to earn more than 50K per year.

## Introduction 
In this Adult dataset ,the task is to see which features contribute more to the income with 14 independent variables i,e race age ,sex ,education etc. 
some are numeric some categorical. Our dataset is imbalaced its means one level income is quite more than other. In this situation we will do some data exploration ,
visualisation and then model building. First we built model with row data and make interpretaion after that make the train data balance ,model building and see the result,
interpretaion and choice of model. We use the logistic regression model to see which features contribute more to the income comparing with machine learning tests like Decision tree, 
Random Forest and Staked Model.

## Objective
- The focus of this project is on predicting if an individual makes more than 50,000 a year. The data used in this project was taken from the 1994 Census Database. 
- Income has always been a popular topic and making a lot of money is something that almost everyone has dream of at some point in their lives.
- In addition, I also wanted to find out which variables had the largest impact in determining the given data. 

## Conclusion
In this analysis I done categorical exploration in the variables and see the comparison which features contribute more to the income.  
Here we can see that Marital status, Working hours and gender are really matters if you wanna earn more than 50k per year.
And we can also see that the private sector's employees contribution is most to earn more than 50k per year.
